# CPI Inflation Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** data to understand inflation trends across categories (Food, Fuel, Transport, etc.) and over time. The objective is to identify **key drivers of inflation**, observe **year-on-year (YoY) movements**, and derive **business and policy-relevant insights** using Excel-based analytics.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description

* **Data Type:** Monthly CPI data
* **Granularity:** Category-wise CPI index and YoY percentage change
* **Time Period:** Multiple years (including pre- and post-2020)
* **Key Variables:**

  * Month / Year
  * CPI Index
  * YoY Inflation (%)
  * Category (Food, Vegetables, Transport, Fuel, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
* Slicers
* Calculated Fields
* Correlation Analysis
* Line Charts & Trend Analysis

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Analysis Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Standardized date formats (Month–Year)
* Verified missing values and data consistency
* Ensured numeric fields were correctly formatted

**Outcome:** Clean, analysis-ready dataset

---

### 2️⃣ Data Reshaping (Pivoting)

* Reshaped raw data using **pivot tables** to create:

  * Category-wise CPI summaries
  * Monthly and yearly aggregations

**Outcome:** Structured tables for easy trend comparison

---

### 3️⃣ Inflation Trend Analysis

* Created **line charts** to visualize:

  * Overall CPI trends
  * Category-wise YoY inflation movements
* Used slicers for dynamic filtering by category and year

**Outcome:** Clear visibility of inflation patterns and volatility

---

### 4️⃣ 2020 Inflation Spike Analysis

* Identified a sharp inflation peak during **2020–21**
* Investigated category-wise contributions

**Insight:**

* Inflation spike was largely **supply-driven** due to COVID-19 disruptions
* Food and essential categories contributed most
* Base-effect dynamics amplified YoY inflation figures

---

### 5️⃣ Category-Specific Deep Dive

#### 🥦 Vegetables

* Observed sharp dips after inflation peaks
* Explained by:

  * Seasonal supply recovery
  * Base-effect normalization

#### 🚍 Transport

* Strong inflation sensitivity to fuel prices

---

### 6️⃣ Correlation Analysis

* Calculated correlation between:

  * **Oil price changes** and **Transport inflation**

**Key Result:**

* ~**67% positive correlation**

**Interpretation:**

* Fuel costs are a major driver of transport inflation
* Global oil price shocks transmit directly into domestic transport prices

---

### 7️⃣ Dashboard Creation

* Built an interactive dashboard using:

  * Pivot charts
  * Slicers for category and year selection
* Ensured consistent data sources to allow automatic updates

**Outcome:** Dynamic, decision-ready dashboard

---

## 📊 Key Insights Summary

* Inflation trends vary significantly by category
* 2020 inflation peak was driven by **supply shocks**, not excess demand
* Food inflation has a disproportionate impact due to high CPI weight
* Transport inflation closely tracks oil price movements
* Post-peak declines often reflect **base-effect dynamics** rather than true deflation

---

## 🎯 Business & Policy Implications

* Stabilizing fuel prices can reduce transport inflation volatility
* Improving supply chain resilience can prevent sharp inflation spikes
* Category-level monitoring is crucial for targeted policy action

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how CPI data can be transformed into actionable insights using structured Excel workflows. By combining trend analysis, correlation studies, and interactive dashboards, the project highlights key inflation drivers and supports informed economic decision-making.
